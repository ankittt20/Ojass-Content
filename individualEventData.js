However, the growth rate of the automobile sector is comparatively slow due to its reliance on the Internal Combustion (I.C.) Engine, which has been in use since time immemorial. While some consider it the most efficient source of transportation, it poses several problems, especially pollution. India needs to undergo a technological reform in the automobile industry and shift towards electric vehicles to mitigate the impacts of global warming. To address this, the Indian Government launched the 'National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020' in 2013 to tackle national energy security, automobile pollution, and production growth. This initiative has attracted the attention of various ecommerce companies such as RECC and Ola. Although challenges may arise in terms of infrastructure and funding, we should take small steps towards our goal of making the world a better place. As engineers, we must recognize the importance of taking action to promote sustainable transportation, and events such as the NEMMP consist of three rounds aimed at achieving this goal.",
